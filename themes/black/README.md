## What is `Black` ?

Black is a 
* **simplistic**,
* `anonymous`, 
* low-profile \
theme. 


Designed with the afore mentioned values in mind, `black` strives to reduce \
clutter by removing anything unnecessary and improve readability by maximizing \
the contrasts between text and backgrounds. \
\
Using simple, globally tested fonts, such as **Inter**, or `Geist Mono` reduces strain \
on your eyes.
